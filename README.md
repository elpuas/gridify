## Description

**Gridify** allows you to easily create a CSS grid layout within your WordPress posts and pages. You can control the number of columns and rows, as well as the gap between grid items. You can also set responsive breakpoints to adjust the number of columns displayed on different screen sizes.

2. Go to the WordPress dashboard and navigate to Plugins > Add New.
3. Click the "Upload Plugin" button and select the zip file you just downloaded.
4. Click the "Install Now" button and activate the plugin.
5. The block will now be available in the editor under the "Layout" category.
